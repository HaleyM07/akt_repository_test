    <h1>Photography</h1> 
    <h2>Why I Love Photography</h2>
    <p>I started photography a few years ago when I got my first camera as a gift. I started to play arond with the settings for different types of photography and found that taking pictures of nature was more sutting to me then photography of people. Since then, capturing moments and playing with light has been a passion of mine.</p>
